# Mithril Helpers

A collection of utilities I find useful when working with [Mithril](https://github.com/MithrilJS/mithril.js).

## Includes:

* DOM utilities for animation.
* Keyboard navigation constraint utility for modals.
* A request wrapper that won't throw errors on HTTP status error codes, and includes the XHR object in the resolved Promise.
